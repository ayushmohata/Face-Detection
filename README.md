#Real-time Face Detection and Counting App

Overview:
This Python application uses OpenCV and pygame to detect and count faces in a live video feed from your webcam. It overlays the detected faces on a background image and displays the total number of people identified.

Features:
Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haarcascade classifier
Face count displayed on the screen
Utilizes pygame for efficient graphics rendering
Customizable background image

Dependencies:
OpenCV
pygame
NumPy

Installation:
Install OpenCV and NumPy using pip:
pip install opencv-python numpy
Install pygame:
pip install pygame
Download the "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" file from OpenCV's website and place it in the same directory as the Python script.
Download a background image of your choice and save it as "bgimg.png" in the same directory.

Usage:
Run the Python script:
python face_detection_app.py
The application will open a window with the live video feed and detected faces.
The total number of faces detected will be displayed on the screen.

Customization:
You can customize the background image by replacing "bgimg.png" with another image of your choice.

Additional Notes:
This application requires a webcam to function.
The accuracy of face detection may vary depending on lighting conditions and other factors.

Further Development:
Implement emotion recognition using facial landmarks.
Enable saving detected faces for further analysis.
Develop a web application for face detection using this code as a base.
Enjoy using this face detection and counting application!
